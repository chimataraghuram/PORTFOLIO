# Mini Game - User Instructions

## How to Play

### 🎮 Interaction Controls

#### **Single Click & Drag**
- **Click and hold** on any shape or button
- **Drag** to move it around
- **Release** to throw it (the faster you drag, the harder it throws!)

#### **Double Click** 
- **Double-click** (two quick clicks within 300ms) on any button or container to activate its function:
  - **Navigation buttons** (Home, About, Skills, etc.) → Scroll to that section
  - **Social icons** (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.) → Open the link in a new tab
  - **Email icon** → Open your email client

### 🔄 Auto-Return Feature

If you throw a shape too far:
- **Too high** (above the visible area)
- **Too far left or right** (out of bounds)

The shape will **automatically return** to the play area after **2-3 seconds**!

This ensures all elements stay playable and don't get lost.
